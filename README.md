Module 1 Challenge
HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

*User Story*
AS A marketing agency
<br> I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
<br> SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

*Acceptance Criteria*
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
<br> WHEN I view the source code
<br> THEN I find semantic HTML elements
<br> WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
<br> THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
<br> WHEN I view the image elements
<br> THEN I find accessible alt attributes
<br> WHEN I view the heading attributes
<br> THEN they fall in sequential order
<br> WHEN I view the title element
<br> THEN I find a concise, descriptive title


*My Application* 
This project displays the landing page for Horiseon Social Solution Services.
<br>I was able to change the element names for things in the HTML sheet to make it more accessible and easier to understand
<br>I was able to correclty link the CSS Style Sheet to my HTML sheet so that the correct styles were added to the elements within my webpage
<br>Everything within the HTML sheet and CSS style sheet is described in the comments above each section to relay the intentions of each section to whomever may read this code
